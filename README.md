# Python-Chat-Bot

Summary: You learn basic java from this Project
The first project I choose to start on the JetBrains Academy/Python Developer.

About
Here, at the beginning of your programmer’s path, creating a simple console chat bot will do wonders to guide you through the basics of coding. During this journey you will also play some word and number games that you are going to implement all on your own. Pack up and let’s hit the road, my friend.

Learning outcomes
You’ll get to know the basic syntax of Python and write a simple program using variables, conditions, loops, and functions.

Reflection:
This was a project I built using python, because I wanted to get a better understanding of python.
With this project I learned the basic syntax of python and taking simple user input and doing
computation on those results.
